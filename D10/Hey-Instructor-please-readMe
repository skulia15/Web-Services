The project description asked for the consumer to write "User was added" etc and also return the json object with came with each event.
Instead we wrote "User was added" and then wrote the contents of the json object in a structured manner. I hope that's fine.
As we understood it the user is supposed to receive a discount when the number of punches he has received for a company exceeds the punchCount of that company.
The variable "how many "unused" punches the user has at this company" we unserstood as the number of punches the user has collected at a company before receiving a discount

To start the server use: yarn execute
To start the consumer use: yarn consume
To start the producer use: yarn produce


To create a user you must provide the admin-token in the "Authorization" header field.
You POST to route: localhost:5001/api/users
	the admin-token is: 598d24f1-3d87-4a0d-980a-d00d461be53b
	When creating a user you must provide a name and a gender:
		User example:  
		{
	       "name": "Rick Sanchez",
	       "gender": "m"
		}

To create a punch, first you will need to create a company. There you must also have the admin-token stated above.
You POST to route: localhost:5001/api/companies
	When creating a company you must provide a name and optionally a punchCount (defaults to 10).
		Company example:
		{
	       "name": "Dimension C-137",
	       "punchCount": 5
	 	}
To add a punch to a user for some company you need to provide 
	- the token of the user you are about to create a punch for in the "Authorization" header.
	- the id of the company you are about to add a punch to.
You POST to route: localhost:5001/api/my/punches
	Punch example:
	{
    	"companyId": "59f1f6e91ab8f71634a07514"
	}
