# Web-Services
Projects for the Web Services course at Reykjavik University

Includes projects implemented in .NET and Node.js

## Getting Started
.Net Core
npm or yarn package managers and a recent version of Node.js

### Installing
For each project in node you will need to run 'npm install' or 'yarn install'

# Course Notes
## Client and Server
### Server side rendering
Pros
* The initial page of a website loads faster
* It’s great for static sites
* It’s rendering is great for SEO (search engine optimization)
* The client can be very light weight

Cons
* Frequent server requests
* Slow rendering
* Full page reloads
* Non-rich (non-dynamic) site interactions

### Client side rendering
Pros
* The server can just send DATA (e.g on JSON format)!
* Each client can render the data differently
* The programming language of the clients doesn´t matter
* Rich site interactions (dynamic interactions)
* Faster rendering
* Web apps!

Cons
* websites won’t be able to load until ALL the JavaScript is
downloaded to the browser
* Bad for SEO
* Initial load slow

## Web services
A web service is:
* Software that is available over the Internet or a private (intranet)
network
* uses a *standardized* messaging system
*  not tied to any one operating system or programming language

## API
Application Programming Interface

A web API is an API that is accessible over the internet

concept, not a technology+

## Different types of web services
SOAP
* xml

WCF (Windows communication foundation)

REST - Representational state transfer
* Usage of standard HTTP
* Different data formats
* performance and scalability
* Main Characteristics:
    * Client and Server are separated
    * Stateless -  State is sent with each request
    * Cacheable
    * Hypertext Driven

## Status Codes
Most common response status codes:

200: OK, request was sucessful

201: Created, Post request created an entity successfully

204: No content, When request doesn't return anything

301: Redirect / Moved permanently, The resource was moved

400: Bad request, Error on clients behalf. Request was incorrect.

401: Unauthorized, Client must specify authentication http header

402: Payment Required

403: Forbidden, The server knows clients idenity but the client isn't allowed to perform this action

404: Not found

412: Precondition failed, Can be used when a particular property is required, but wasn't provided by the client

500: Server error. Nothing a client can do

503: Service unavailable


## CRUD
Four basic functions of dealing with data
* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete


## Restful services
**[FromBody]** attribute states that this parameter is to be found in the body of the incoming request

ModelState.IsValid checks whether the model from the request‘s body is
valid.

CreatedAtRoute method returns the route to the newly created resource

### Query parameters
Might look like this:  www.somedomain.com/api/records?genre=Rock

? denotes the start of a query string

Key - value pair
*  key is genre and value is Rock

The **[FromQuery]** attribute states that this parameter is to be found in the query string in the URL

## API Documentation
ASP.NET Web API, we can do this by using XML comments

XML comments should be added to:
* Controllers
* Controller methods
* Model classes passed in or returned from controller methods (both the classes
themselves and their properties)

XML documentation Example:
~~~~
/// <summary>
/// BlaBlaBla
/// </summary>
~~~~


## Models
 entity models:  C# classes that map
directly to a database table
* they look exactly like that corresponding database table
*  not a good idea to expose these models to the consumers of our web API 
* Good idea to have multiple models representing **the same** model

Entity models
* These are the models that map directly to our database tables and they should
only be use within the repository layers of our application

DTO models
* the models we would return to HTTP GET requests
* It is very common to have the models that the API return different from
the models that a user of the API would provide in the body of a POST request
* represents a *Lighter* version of a record

View models
* These are the models that the consumer would send in a request body when
sending a HTTP POST or PUT requests
*  it doesn’t make sense that the consumer can create every field of a model
*  Some fields should simply be generated by the database or the code of the Web API
